# README

This is the same project of [PrayersMX](https://github.com/luisMartinez011/prayersMX) but it uses AWS RDS service with Postgres. I was having compatibility problems with gems that were designed for [Mongoid gem](https://github.com/mongodb/mongoid), but some gems were outdated or had horrible documentation. I become exhausted so I decided to switch back to using RDS databases. Another reason for leaving the other project is that Mongoid does not use ActiveRecord, and most gems compatible with Ruby on Rails use ActiveRecord.

This project is for a final project.
